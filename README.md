 👋 Hi, I’m @Pluviophile006
 👀 I'm interested in skipping and anime.
 🌱I'm currently learning Java, Python, HTML, and CSS (from bro code)
 ❤️ I'm not looking to collaborate with anyone because I'm new to GitHub I don't know much about this and I haven't done many projects so I'm currently working on myself before doing anything.
 📫 How to reach me ...
